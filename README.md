# FluidSim
Basic lattic fluid simulation built on my PhysicsLibrary physics and graphics library.

Have a look at some of the pictures and videos!

The pictures are names with the viscosity of the flow. In some the colour encodes the direction (as an angle) of the flow, whereas in some the colour encodes the density.
