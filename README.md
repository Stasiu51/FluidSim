# FluidSim
Basic lattic fluid simulation built on my PhysicsLibrary physics and graphics library.

Have a look at some of the pictures and videos!

https://vimeo.com/748805482 - colour represents density, where colourmap dynamically adjusts over time (as the fluid becomes more uniform) to keep the visible colour variance constant.

The pictures are names with the viscosity of the flow. In some the colour encodes the direction (as an angle) of the flow, whereas in some the colour encodes the density.
